# PM2.5_sources

This repository includes the analysis I did for my Master thesis when completing my Master of Public Health in Spring 2021. I used Absolute Principal Components Anlysis (APCA) to source apportion fine particulate matter (PM2.5), using chemical speciation data for fine particulate matter in New York City. In other words, I looked at the chemical composition of fine particulate matter, used APCA as a dimentionality reduction tool for pattern recognition, and identified from those results sources of PM2.5, such as traffic and industrial pollution. In a subsequent analysis, I put these identified sources into a health model to find out which sources were associated with heart attack incidence in New York City (the code for those analyses are not available publicly).
